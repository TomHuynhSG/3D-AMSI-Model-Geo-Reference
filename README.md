A geo-reference project to 3D model [Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute (AMSI)](https://amsi.org.au/) building and geographically map it on the Google map.


## Description

I am assigned in the geo-reference project which have the goals:
- Create an one-to-one 3D model of Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute (AMSI) building in the University of Melbourne.
- Geo-reference the 3D model at the correct latitude and longtitude of the real one to be displayed on the Google Map.

Here are some photos of the real building:

Here is the location of the AMSI building on the Google Map:
